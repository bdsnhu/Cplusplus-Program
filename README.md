# Cplusplus-Program
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Project 3-1 was about Chada Tech wanting me to create a 12-hour, and 24-hour on their clients website. So I created code in C++ to display the time in 12-hour clock, and the 24-hour clock. After that, I created a menu for the user to change the time. The menu that I created is: 1 to Add One Hour, 2 to Add One Minute, 3 to Add One Second, and 4 to Exit The Program.
What did you do particularly well?
Showing both clocks, and changing the times.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my code at: ampm = "PM";. These improvements would make my code more efficient, and secure, because I can use AM as well.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The pieces of the code that I found the most challenging to write, is that: ampm = "PM";, because I was trying to figure out how I could incorporate using AM as well, but I had to use PM for the 24-hour clock. I overcame this with the Academic Support. The tools or resources that I am adding to my support network are: my family, my friends, and my professors.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work are: knowing how to create clocks in C++ code, and maybe combining with another programming language.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable, by having while loops, and displaying the clocks, and displaying the menu.
